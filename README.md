# Challenge: Destiny App

This is an app I built as a part of a challenge for 'The Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart' course on Udemy. 


## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

To run the application you must have a physical android/ios device or a physical device setup from device manager in android studio/xcode.
